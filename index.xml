      <description>Today is the day that I was to leave to begin my trip. Unfortunately, that did not happen.
About ten days ago, I took a clumsy slip off of a trailer that was wet after a rainstorm. A minor injury, I said to myself. To be on the safe side, I took a trip to urgent care. It turns out that the &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; injury was a fracture to my fifth metatarsal.</description>

      <description>I am preparing for a year-long adventure across Europe and Asia. During this travel, I aim to explore and experience new cultures, meet new people, and learn more about myself. The journey will begin on July 12th as I travel to my first destination: Barcelona, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
From there I will spend a month, using Barcelona as a home base to explore other areas of Spain and the surrounding countries. Aside from that first destination, the rest of the trip is largely unplanned.</description>
