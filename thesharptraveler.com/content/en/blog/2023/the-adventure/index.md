I am preparing for a year-long adventure across Europe and Asia. During this travel, I aim to explore and experience new cultures, meet new people, and learn more about myself. The journey will begin on July 12th as I travel to my first destination: Barcelona, Spain ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸

From there I will spend a month, using Barcelona as a home base to explore other areas of Spain and the surrounding countries. Aside from that first destination, the rest of the trip is largely unplanned.

I do have a rough idea of places I'd like to visit:

- ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· Greece
- ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ Italy
- ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· France
- ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· Turkey
- ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ India
- ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· Korea
- ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡­ Thailand

I've left my job so I can stay focused on my goal. I'll also use this time to work on a startup idea I have, so that hopefully in a year I'll be able to launch that business.

Follow along with me as I embark on this life-changing experience
