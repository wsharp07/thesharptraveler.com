Today is the day that I was to leave to begin my trip. Unfortunately, that did not happen.

About ten days ago, I took a clumsy slip off of a trailer that was wet after a rainstorm. A minor injury, I said to myself. To be on the safe side, I took a trip to urgent care. It turns out that the "minor" injury was a fracture to my fifth metatarsal. In layman's terms, it was a fracture to the bone that attaches to my pinky toe.

My immediate thoughts turned to how this would impact my trip. Europe, in general, is a walking-heavy continent. Having a fractured foot impacts the enjoyment of that environment.

I started by attempting to cancel or move my airline and lodging commitments. Luckily, the airline was pretty straightforward as Chase helped with that. Airbnb was not as easy. I missed the cancellation window, and the host had their hands tied on what they could do. Ultimately, I kept my reservation but delayed my trip.

Not great to start the trip with a loss of ðŸ’¸

However, my spirits are high. All roads have bumps in them. Mine just happened to be at the beginning.
