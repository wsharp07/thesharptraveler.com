      <description>I am preparing for a year-long adventure across Europe and Asia. During this travel, I aim to explore and experience new cultures, meet new people, and learn more about myself. The journey will begin on July 12th as I travel to my first destination: Barcelona, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸
From there I will spend a month, using Barcelona as a home base to explore other areas of Spain and the surrounding countries. Aside from that first destination, the rest of the trip is largely unplanned.</description>
