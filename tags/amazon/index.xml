      <description>Summary We use Amazon almost on a daily basis in the States. Is it as easy and accessible overseas? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
Which Amazon? If you log in to Amazon.com you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to ship items to another country, however, this will ship items from the US to that country, which is not what you want.
Instead, Amazon offers different versions of its site and app for different countries. Navigate to the country selection page and choose the appropriate country.</description>
